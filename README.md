## Project Name & Pitch

Chess Puzzles

A web app that generates chess puzzles, built with Python, JavaScript, and Flask.

## Project Context

This project's purpose is to help users improve at chess by generating chess puzzles for the user to solve. The main project goal was to improve my understanding of Python and JavaScript for web development.

## Reflection

#### Unexpected Challenges:
  - One key issue was how to represent the data for each chezz puzzle and the solution to each puzzle. My solution was to create an object that holds an 8x8 2d array representing the chess board and the pieces on them, and arrays representing the position of the piece that should be moved and the position that it should be moved to.
  - Another challenge was manipulating the highlighting of spots on the board that the user clicks on. The solution was to assign identifiers to each spot on the board and using Vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the background color of the spot on mouse click events.

#### What I Learned/Improved Upon:
  - Flask
  - Python syntax
  - Templating
  - Deploying the webapp
  - Third-party JavaScript libraries
  - Image size manipulation
  - Vanilla JavaScript
